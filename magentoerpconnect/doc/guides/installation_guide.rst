************
Installation
************

The installation steps assume that you already have a working OpenERP
setup with all the OpenERP pre-requisites.

Requirements on both servers
============================

The ``ntp`` package should be install on the servers hosting Magento and
OpenERP to ensure a correct synchronization between them

OpenERP
=======

Download the branches where you installed OpenERP::

    $ bzr branch lp:openerp-connector/7.0 connector
    $ bzr branch lp:openerp-connector/7.0-e-commerce-addons e-commerce-addons
    $ bzr branch lp:openerp-connector/7.0-magentoerpconnect magentoerpconnect
    $ bzr branch lp:openerp-product-attributes/7.0 openerp-product-attributes

Add the branches in the addons path, either using the server command
line or adding them in the OpenERP server configuration file.

You also need to install the ``magento`` Python package.
So install it with either pip or either easy_install::

    $ pip install magento

    $ easy_install magento

Note that you may need to use the root rights on your system.

In OpenERP, update the modules list using `Settings > Modules > Update
Modules List`.

Go to the menu `Settings > Modules > Installed Modules`, remove the
`Installed` filter and search for `Magento Connector`, then click on
`Install`.


Magento
=======

For the time being, the Magento extension originally built by OpenLabs
is still used  by the connector. But the version published on `Magento
Connect` is outdated.

Download the following branch and install it in Magento::

    $ bzr branch lp:magentoerpconnect/magento-module-oerp6.x-stable magento-module

In order to install it:

1. Move the `Openlabs` folder in the
   `magento_root/app/code/community`.
#. Move the file `app/etc/modules/Openlabs_OpenERPConnector.xml` in
   `magento_root/app/etc/modules`.
#. Flush the Magento cache from the admin panel or by removing everything in
   `magento_root/var/cache`

Configuring the Magento web-services
====================================

1. In the Magento admin panel, go to `System > Web-Services >
   SOAP/XML-RPC - Roles`.
#. Create a new role named `openerp` with access to `All` resources.
#. In `System > Web-Services > SOAP/XML-RPC - Users`, create a new user
   named as you want, for instance `openerp_connect`, and an API key.
   In `User Role`, choose the `openerp` role.
